===============VERSION 1.0===
Required Software: Java JRE7, Python 3.2

In this version users can use the Python program main.py (USE run_main.bat TO RUN) to update the text files that keep track of the files in the file system. Users currently can put files and folders into the directory SampleFolder while main.py is running to put files into the system. 

NOTE: Currently, the background python program cannot run at the same time as the java program. The java program will interfere with the python program's edits to the text files which means files added during that time will not actually be listed in the text files (and thus the java program).

The java program, run using TagsRunner.java, creates a basic GUI interface that uses text files generated by main.py to keep track of tags and files. Left panel updates files lists using tag queries. Middle panel contains a list of file names. Right panel contains tag checkboxes that allows users to tag files.

TODO: 
	1. Allow users to import files and folders into the system using the GUI so that folders automatically become tags.
	2. Develop a comprehensive menu.
	3. Translate the Python program into java so that it can be run in any environment.
	4. Change the background
	5. Reduce name changing of the files being imported.
	6. Make interface more windows-like.
	7. Allow selected files to be opened (or at least displayed in a file explorer).
	8. Allow right click menu that has multiple options.
	9. Implement file explorer options and feel to the file panel.
	10. Use a database rather than a text file to store data.
	11. Allow for sorting of files and tags.
	12. Allow for searching of tags and files by name.
	13. Allow background program to connect to main program so everything automatically updates with no interference.
